The error message indicates that the service descriptor is unable to resolve the \u0060ev2Context\u0060 type while attempting to activate the \u0060CategoriaService\u0060 class.\r\n\r\nThis might be happening because the \u0060ev2Context\u0060 type is not registered in the dependency injection container. The \u0060CategoriaService\u0060 class has a constructor that requires an instance of \u0060ev2Context\u0060, but the container is unable to provide it. \r\n\r\nTo fix this error, you can register the \u0060ev2Context\u0060 type in the dependency injection container. You can do this by adding the following line of code to the \u0060ConfigureServices\u0060 method in your \u0060Startup.cs\u0060 file:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nservices.AddDbContext\u003Cev2Context\u003E();\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis will register the \u0060ev2Context\u0060 type in the container and allow it to be resolved when the \u0060CategoriaService\u0060 class is constructed.\r\n\r\nIf this does not solve the error, there may be additional code in your application that is contributing to the error. You can try adding more information to the error message by catching the exception and logging additional details. This may help you identify the root cause of the error.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["What is dependency injection?","How can I catch and log exceptions in my application?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"ExplainException","LoggedSkillInvocations":null}
